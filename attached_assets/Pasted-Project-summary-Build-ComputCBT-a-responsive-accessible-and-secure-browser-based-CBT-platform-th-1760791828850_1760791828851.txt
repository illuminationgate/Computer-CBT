Project summary
Build ComputCBT, a responsive, accessible, and secure browser-based CBT platform that delivers single-subject MCQ exams (WAEC/NECO style). Students land on a single-page form to enter name, select gender, and pick a subject; the selected paper runs with an automatic countdown, autosave, navigation controls, and final scoring. Results show student details, time taken, raw score, and percentage.

Requirements & acceptance criteria
1. Landing page (Login & Subject selection)
•	Fields:
o	Full name (required; 3–100 chars; letters, spaces, hyphens allowed).
o	Gender (dropdown: Male, Female; required).
o	Subject (single-select dropdown containing the list below; required).
•	Footer displays contact email: admin@computcbt.com.ng.
•	"Start Exam" button launches the exam only if validations pass.
•	Single attempt per page load / session (refreshing after start should warn about losing progress unless reloaded deliberately).
•	Use the video file as a pre-loader of about 4 seconds before the landing page will come up.
2. Subjects, number of questions & durations
Use this table exactly:
Subject	Number of questions	Duration (minutes)
Agricultural Science	50	50
Biology	50	50
Chemistry	50	60
Christian Religious Studies	50	60
Civic Education	50	60
Commerce	50	50
Computer Studies	50	60
Economics	50	60
English Language	80	60
Financial Accounting	60	60
Government	50	60
Islamic Religious Studies	50	50
Literature in English	50	60
Mathematics	50	90
Physics	50	75
•	On the exam start, display a short pre-check modal summarizing subject, # questions, and duration; require user confirmation.
•	The file that contains all the questions and answer are also uploaded
3. Exam behavior & UI
•	One question at a time UI, showing:
o	Question number / total (e.g., Q 5 / 50).
o	Question text and up to 5 options (A–E). Options may be fewer.
o	Radio buttons for single answer selection.
•	Navigation: Back and Next buttons.
o	Disabled when at first/last question appropriately.
o	Clicking Next autosaves current answer and moves forward.
•	Timer:
o	Starts as soon as the exam begins (after pre-check confirm).
o	Visible, persistent countdown in header (HH:MM:SS).
o	Auto-submit occurs immediately when timer reaches 00:00:00.
•	Autosave:
o	Persist answers locally and to server every 10 seconds and on every navigation action.
o	If network is lost, continue saving locally and sync when connection is restored.
•	Submit button:
o	Allows manual submission anytime.
o	Show a confirmation modal: “Are you sure? This will submit your paper and cannot be undone.” (Yes/Cancel).
•	Unanswered questions:
o	Allow users to skip and return later.
o	Show quick nav (optional collapsed grid or question palette) to jump to any question and to see answered/unanswered states.
•	Accessibility:
o	Keyboard accessible (Tab order, Enter to select, arrow keys to navigate radio group).
o	Screen-reader friendly (aria labels).
•	Design:
o	Clean, distraction-free, professional UI.
o	Responsive across phones, tablets, desktops.
4. Scoring & result
•	Scoring rules:
o	Correct answer = 1 mark
o	Wrong answer = 0
o	Unanswered = 0
•	After submission (manual or auto):
o	Show Result Page containing:
	Full Name
	Gender
	Subject
	Time Taken (HH:MM:SS)
	Score (e.g., 42 / 50)
	Percentage (rounded to 2 decimal places)
o	Option to download/print a simple result card (PDF).
o	Option to review answers with correct answers shown (toggle on/off).
5. Data & API expectations (minimum)
•	Question model (JSON) example:
{
  "id": "eng_q001",
  "subject": "English Language",
  "text": "Choose the correct synonym for 'abundant'.",
  "options": [
    {"key":"A","text":"Scarce"},
    {"key":"B","text":"Plentiful"},
    {"key":"C","text":"Tiny"},
    {"key":"D","text":"Brief"}
  ],
  "correct": "B"
}
•	Client->Server endpoints (suggested):
o	POST /api/exam/start → create session, return examId, questions (or IDs).
o	POST /api/exam/{examId}/answer → save answer (payload: questionId, selectedOption, timestamp).
o	GET /api/exam/{examId}/status → get remaining time, saved answers.
o	POST /api/exam/{examId}/submit → submit and calculate score.
o	GET /api/exam/{examId}/result → fetch final result.
•	Server must validate answers and calculate score on submit (do not trust client-side scoring).
6. Reliability, security & integrity
•	Use secure transport (HTTPS).
•	Protect against tampering:
o	Do not expose correct in client payloads.
o	Server-side timer enforcement — ignore client time submissions if inconsistent.
•	Lock exam session to one active token; prevent multiple simultaneous submits from different tabs.
•	Rate-limit start/submit endpoints to mitigate abuse.
•	Basic anti-cheat:
o	Warn on page/tab switches (optional: log focus changes).
o	Prevent copy/paste of question text (optional).
•	Store logs of autosaves and final submission for audit.
7. Edge-cases & behaviors
•	Network drop: allow exam to continue offline with local autosave; sync when online. If sync fails at submit, keep local copy and retry automatically.
•	Browser close/refresh: warn the user that progress is saved (if logged) or may be lost (if no server session); on re-open, try to recover using server session id or local storage.
•	Time manipulation attempts: server should compute remaining time based on server start timestamp; client timer is only UI.
8. Testing & QA
•	Unit tests for scoring logic and API endpoints.
•	Integration tests for autosave, submit, and offline sync.
•	Cross-browser responsive tests (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari mobile).
•	Load test for concurrent exam starts/submits (define expected concurrency in planning).
9. Deliverables
•	Production-ready frontend (HTML/CSS/JS or SPA framework) with source code.
•	Backend API and database schema (sample migrations).
•	Sample seed data: 2–5 questions per subject for QA, plus scripts to import full question sets.
•	README with setup/deploy instructions.
•	Basic test suite and instructions to run it.
•	Demo deployment (optional): link to a hosted demo or instructions to run locally.
10. Suggested tech stack (optional)
•	Frontend: React / Vue / Svelte (SPA), Tailwind CSS for styling.
•	Backend: Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI) or PHP (Laravel).
•	Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL.
•	Optional hosting: Vercel/Netlify for frontend + Render/Heroku/DigitalOcean for API; use managed DB.
•	Use JWT or short-lived session tokens for exam sessions.
